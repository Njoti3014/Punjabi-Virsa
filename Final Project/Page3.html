    <h3>Langar-The Community Kitchen</h3>
    <img id="langar" src="images/langar.jpg" alt="langar" height="200" width="200">
    Langar, the community kitchen, is a cornerstone of Sikhism that embodies the principles of equality, humility, and selfless service (Seva). Established by Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, Langar serves as a powerful expression of the faith's values and continues to play a vital role in Sikh communities worldwide.
    
    <h4>The Essence of Langar</h4>   
    <ul>
        <li><b>Equality:</b> Everyone is welcome to partake in Langar, regardless of caste, creed, religion, gender, or socio-economic status. In the Langar hall, all sit together on the floor as equals, emphasizing the Sikh belief in universal brotherhood.</li>
        <li><b>Selfless Service:</b> Langar is prepared and served by volunteers, known as sevadars. This voluntary service fosters a sense of community and humility. </li>
        <li><b>Free of Charge:</b> The meals provided in Langar are completely free, supported by donations from the community. </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Historical Significance</h4>
    Guru Nanak initiated the concept of Langar to challenge the deeply entrenched caste system of his time. By ensuring that people of all backgrounds shared a meal together, he sought to break down social barriers and promote unity.<br>
    Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of Sikhism, institutionalized Langar further, mandating that anyone wishing to meet him must first partake in the communal meal, reinforcing the value of equality.<br>

<br>
<h4>How Langar Works</h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>Preparation:</b> Meals are cooked in Gurdwaras (Sikh places of worship) by volunteers using simple, nutritious ingredients like lentils, rice, bread (roti), and vegetables.</li>
    <li><b>Serving:</b> The food is served in the Langar hall, where people sit in rows on the floor to symbolize equality.</li>
    <li><b>Clean-Up:</b> Volunteers also manage cleaning, from washing dishes to tidying up the Langar hall.
    </li>
