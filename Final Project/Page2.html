        <h2>Sikh Gurus</h2>
        <p>The Sikh Gurus are the spiritual masters of Sikhism, who established the religion over the course of about two and a half centuries, beginning in 1469. The year 1469 marks the birth of "Guru Nanak Dev ji", the founder of Sikhism. He was succeeded by nine other human gurus until, in 1708, the Guruship was finally passed on by the tenth guru to the holy Sikh scripture, Guru Granth Sahib ji, which is now considered the living Guru by the followers of the Sikh faith. The guruship was also passed onto the Guru Panth, consisting of the Khalsa, however this means of guruship went into decline following to rise of "Maharaja Ranjit Singh ji".</p>

            <p>
                The Khanda is a powerful symbol in Sikhism, representing the dual concept of Miri and Piri, which signifies the balance between spiritual and temporal authority. It is composed of three elements: the double-edged sword in the center (Khanda), symbolizing divine knowledge; the circle around it (Chakkar), representing unity and eternity; and the two swords on the sides (Kirpans), which stand for Miri and Piri. This emblem encapsulates Sikh values of justice, resilience, and harmony.
